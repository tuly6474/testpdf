        <p>The iPhone 14 series will be the star of Apple’s “Far Out” September event. With four new models set to be introduced, expect a lot of hype from a new iPhone 14 Plus. Although the regular models won’t have much to differentiate from the current iPhone 13 generation, a bigger model will be a nice addition.

            Expect great changes for the iPhone 14 Pro at the Apple September event, as reported by 9to5Mac. With a new design, a better processor, and huge improvements on the camera’s side, the iPhone 14 series will likely be one of the biggest Apple launches in years.</p>
